Pluto
=============
Pluto is a blog aggregator written in Go, with Foundation styling to get you started. Pluto powers [Planet-hackNY](https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/Planet-hackNY).

Configuration & Setup
-----------------------


You will need the following environment variables defined:

````shell
#Any value will do, as long as it is secret and difficult to predict
export COOKIE_SECRET=""

#Database credentials
export MONGODB_USERNAME=""
export MONGODB_PASSWORD=""
export MONGODB_URL=""
export MONGODB_DATABASE=""
````

If you are running the app on Heroku, run:

````shell
heroku config:set COOKIE_SECRET=$COOKIE_SECRET MONGODB_USERNAME=$MONGODB_USERNAME MONGODB_PASSWORD=$MONGODB_PASSWORD MONGODB_URL=$MONGODB_URL MONGODB_DATABASE=$MONGODB_DATABASE
````

which will copy the values from your current environment to use on the Heroku server.


*If you are running mongodb locally* (or if your mongodb instance isn't protected by a username/password, you can ommit the `MONGODB_USERNAME` and `MONGODB_PASSWORD` variables; however, you will need to delete the call to the Login method:

````go
	err = mongodb_session.DB(MONGODB_DATABASE).Login(MONGODB_USERNAME, MONGODB_PASSWORD)
````
would then be replaced with 

````go
	err = mongodb_session.DB(MONGODB_DATABASE)
````
